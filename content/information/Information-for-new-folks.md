## Rule Book

It's important to know the rules by heart. Many veteran officials can quote the rule book by memory and recite the rule number. It's helpful to have a good understanding of these rules when resolving conflicts with teams, as being able to quote from memory saves everyone time, and makes you look more professsional.

There are however, an lot of rules. So we understand it will take new folks some time before they are able to fully up to speed.

You can find the rules:

- [In print form](http://www.nfhs.com/c-204-football.aspx)
- [As an App](https://nfhs.org/sports-resource-content/nfhs-rules-app-information/)

?You will be provided a physical rule book during training?

Some example Quizes that are helpful to test yourself:

## Uniforms

Football is unique in that it likely requires a larger upfront investment of equipment then most other sports.  Luckily, you’ll likely be able to pay for your equipment through the first two weeks of youth games. \

- Jersey – 2 inch striped shirt. For the first few weeks you will be fine with a short sleeve shirt. Late September you will likely require a long sleeve as the weather gets colder. My favorite brand is Smittys. See below for options.
- Pants – Eventually you will need the required black pants with the white stripe down the side.  Again, I prefer Smitty’s but there are many brands out there.  They come needing to be hemmed, so in the meantime you will be fine with black shorts. 
- Black Belt w/ Silver buckle, most pants come with this.
- Black Hat
- Black shoes – Can have white on sides.

## Accessories

For those that do not already have things, it's likely others might have extras they could let you borrow while you learn more and have the ability to buy your own equipment.

- Yellow Flag – I prefer ones with Black ball.
- Beanbags – Ideally 2 but 1 for now will work
- Finger whistle – You shouldn’t plan on using a whistle with a lanyard until you are much more experienced.
- Down Indicator
- Clips (2) – As you all will be starting as Head Line-Judge

## Sourcing Equipment

My favorite site for equipment is Purchaseofficials.com.  They have great service and are quick to deliver. Other sites for equipment are Allsportseast.com and Honigs.com.

Reach out if you have any questions about equipment.

Please do not let equipment be a deterrent to starting, if that is an issue we likely can work something out.

Also please know, that we do not require first year officials to pay dues knowing that an investment into equipment is required.

If we know that weather forecasts predict possible thunder/lightning during the game we have to be prepared. 

Prior to kickoff the referee should talk to the game site administrator as to where both teams will locate to in the case of thunder/lightning and pass this message along to both team coaches. 

It is the responsibility of the officials on the field to stop the game with the first sound of thunder or first clash of lightning. 

At this time we start the 30 minute pause which will restart with any new sightings or sounds of electrical storms regardless of where we think the storm is. 

It is up to joint discussion between officials, coaches and administrators if the game is to be cancelled with the final decision being made by the game administrator. 

Rule 3-Art 5 on page 41 of the rule book helps explain the thought process.
